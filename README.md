# Citation Manager Site with React and Redux

## About this Project
Copyright is always a concern when people are sharing information online, and the citation 
records for images, in particular, can be relatively complex. I hope to build a site that makes it 
easy to find great images, along with their citation information. Hopefully, providing a curated
list will encourage the use and reuse of clearly licensed online images.

Also, since I'm learning about what React is capable of, I look forward to applying lessons about 
things like Breadcrumbs, linking to a database, and maybe allowing users to login to save their own records.
